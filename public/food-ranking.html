<h1> BEST FOOD I ATE LATELY </h1>
<hr />
<h2> Savory</h2>
<h3> Hashville mild chicken strips with Hashville sauce </h3>
<p> should've gotten hot instead of mild , but ohh wasnt that good , the chicken was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside 
   the spices on the crust were lemony , the sauce , the fries and the cold cola just did it for me 9/10
</p>

<h3> A Shrooms Burger from Daddy's Burger  </h3>
<p> its like the charbroiled burger from Buffalo Burger but 5x better , the caramalized onions gave a hint of sweetness with the shrooms and nachos on the side with the honey mustard dip
     ugh im so hungry again 8/10
</p>
<h2> Sweet</h2>
<h3> Custard filled donut from bakery khan </h3>
<p> exceeded all expectations , highly doubted the white chocolate and caramel glaze but they carriedddd , also the custard
    was runny and just heavenly only mad that i finished it  10/10  </p>
